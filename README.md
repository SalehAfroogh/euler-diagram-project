This project evaluates relationships between two sets based on Euler diagrams and visualizes the results. It supports common set relationships such as subset, disjoint, intersection, and more, and uses Euler diagrams (Venn-style) to illustrate them.

## Project Overview

This project allows users to compare two sets and visualize the logical relationship between them using an Euler diagram. The relationships evaluated include:

- **Subset**: `All A are B`
- **Disjoint Sets**: `No A is B`
- **Partial Overlap**: `Some A is B`
- **Partial Non-membership**: `Some A is not B`

The visualization is done using a Venn diagram, and the results are saved as images in the `visuals/` directory.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need Python 3.8+ and the following dependencies.

### Steps to install:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd euler_diagram_project
Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Running the Program
Place your data file (sample_sets.txt) in the data/ folder.

The file should follow this format:

plaintext
Copy code
set_a: 1, 2, 3
set_b: 3, 4, 5
Run the main program:

bash
Copy code
python euler_diagram_project/main.py
The program will evaluate the relationship between the sets and display a Venn diagram. The results are saved in the visuals/ directory.

Example
Suppose you have the following sets:

plaintext
Copy code
set_a: 1, 2, 3
set_b: 3, 4, 5
The program will output the relationship: Some A is B, and generate a Venn diagram showing the partial overlap. The result will be saved as Some A is B.png in the visuals/ folder.

Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python packages:

matplotlib
matplotlib-venn
You can install all dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Yes, you can copy and paste the entire content I provided into your README.md file.

Steps to do so in PyCharm:
In PyCharm, navigate to the docs/ folder (or wherever your README.md file is located).
If you don't have a README.md file, right-click on the folder and select New > File, then name it README.md.
Open the README.md file.
Copy and paste the provided content into the file.
Save the file (Ctrl+S or Command+S).
This will create a proper documentation file for your project, making it easier for others to understand and use your program. Let me know if you need further help!
